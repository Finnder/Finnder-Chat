# Finnder Chat

## Description
Currently only supports a local server on your own wifi
and other clients can connect to it that are connected to your wifi.

Eventually I want to move to a dedicated Public IP address for the server.
## Current Features
- A nice UI... kinda
- Nicknames, when you load up the client it will ask you for a nickname & these will be displayed when typing a message.

## Future Plans
- Emojies?
- Accounts? (SQL or Firebase Database?)
- Mini-Games?
- Voice Chat?
- Better Looking UI (Tkinter has it's limitations)

## Imports 
- socket (SERVER)
- theading (Used For Multi-threading capabilities & SERVER Efficiency)
- tkinter (UI)
- colorama (Terminal Colors)
- pickle (Good for sending Objects/Data between Client and Server)
